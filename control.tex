\section*{Control Mechanisms}
Given the possibility that swarming entities can operate autonomously, manually controlled, or both, there has been much research and reporting on their control systems which has driven the development of decentralized and centralized control architectures. These components play an important role in the interactions between individual swarm agents, including their designated actions which can be based on information dictated, exchanged, and acquired. The operational efficiency of the distribution of tasks can be attributed to features such as hardware, software (intelligence algorithms, if any), capacity, and environment.
